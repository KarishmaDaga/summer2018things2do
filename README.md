# summer2018things2do

### Summer 2019 Interview Prep
- [ ] need to be comfortable with leetcode mediums
  - [ ] work on 1 leetcode easy/med every other day starting in may
- [ ] create app -> ios (for qwic? for lecture tracking app?)
- [ ] work through flowing data tutorials, learn r, analyze data sets 

### Academic Goals
- [ ] learn rings and fields material 
  - [ ] read notes from semester alongside the textbook (Thomas Hungerford, Abstract Algebra)
  - [ ] work through problem sets
- [ ] make basecs equiv for probability and statistics (and rings and fields??)

### Internship Goals
- [ ] Explore Seattle, have fun, and make friends
- [ ] Put 100% into my project
- [ ] Don't be afraid to learn from others (interns, mentors, execs, whoever). Embrace & seek out wisdom.

### Extras
- [ ] figure out how I can take a fall & winter semesters off after 3rd year summer to do more internships/research 
  - ask uw guy, jnthan sun?

Unlike when I was 27, I feel a lot less certain about my life trajectory now. If you were to ask me where Iâ€™d like to be in another six years, I would simply point to all the creative flailing, U-turns and relentless question-asking of the past six years. But if thereâ€™s one thing I do know, itâ€™s this: there is nothing to fear about all this uncertainty. Because I know that no matter where I go next, there will always be much to learn and many opportunities to grow along the way.
